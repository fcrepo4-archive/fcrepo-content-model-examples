fcrepo-content-model-examples
=============================

This project contains sets of Fedora 4 content models from a variety of institutions. In some cases legacy Fedora 3 content models are supplied as a reference. This project has an integration test that verifies that content models are valid in Fedora 4. It will start a Fedora instance and add each CND file that is within a model-sets subdirectory (see src/test/resources/model-sets).

Feel free to contribute your own folder with example Fedora content models.
